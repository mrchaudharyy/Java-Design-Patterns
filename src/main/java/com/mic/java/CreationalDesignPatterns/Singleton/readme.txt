What is Singleton Design Pattern?
 -> A class of which only single instance can exist will follow this pattern.

    Things to remember:

    1. Per instance per JVM
    2. Static in nature
    3. Thread Safe
    4. Must have private Constructor
    5. Private Instance of the Class
    6. No parameters in the Constructor
    7. JEE7 has @Singleton annotation



In the package "breaking" you'll find how to break singleton
In the package "preventing" you'll find how to prevent singleton from breaking
